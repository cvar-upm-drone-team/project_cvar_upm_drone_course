# CVAR-UPM Drone Course (ROS 2 + Aerostack2)

This repository contains the practical material for a drone course from **Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM)**.
This course was developed by the **CVAR Group (Computer Vision & Aerial Robotics), UPM**:
https://cvar-upm.github.io/drone_racing_web/
The course is based on **ROS 2 Humble** and **[Aerostack2](https://aerostack2.github.io/)**, and focuses on both multirotor control and computer-vision tasks for autonomous drone racing in a gate-circuit simulation.
